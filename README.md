# Survive the Supernova

*Oh no! I overslept! Oh for sap-wine's sake the sun is already exploding...  
Well uh, might as well roast a marhmellow while I wait.*  

*...huh. Shouldn't I be dead by now?*

Disables the SupernovaDestructionVolume and the ATP, so you can fly around the post-Supernova Solar System.
The supernova is also triggered at the start of the loop by default, but this can be disabled in the config.

In the config you can:
 - Disable the automatic trigger of the supernova at the start of the loop
 - Disable the supernova rumble sound for a peaceful flight

Happy flying!
